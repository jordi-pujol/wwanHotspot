  * For better routing advising installation of other IP related packages.
    - the iproute package (formelly named only ip) will set one default route
      for each WAN interface that is enabled.
    - conntrack ensures that the delivery of IP packets is done correctly
      when multiple default routes are enabled.
    - as an extra bonus, iptables-mod-ipopt allows to create rules based
      on MAC.
  * files/wwanHotspot.sh:
    A great improvement for smooth operation when disabling or enabling Hotspot's
    wireless device.
    - When the Hotspot connection has been lost don't restart network, only
      reset wifi and watch for enabling the wifi connection,
      therefore continue immediately trying to connect to another Hotspot.
    - Watch the wifi connection in every point where the wifi interface
      has been enabled or disabled.
    - When scanning for available hotspots be sure of that iw obtains the list
      without wifi network error.
    - Better management of sleeping intervals.
    - Automatically restart the network when iw scanning returns a network
      error several times.
  * files/wwanHotspot.config:
    Set Debug to "xtrace" to log shell commands on /var/log/wwanHotspot.xtrace
