# Connect to this list of networks.
#
# the values are taken from a manually configured connection issuing the
# following commands:
#    uci -q get wireless.@wifi-iface[1].ssid
#    uci -q get wireless.@wifi-iface[1].encryption
#    uci -q get wireless.@wifi-iface[1].key
#
# net_ssid is the real ssid
# net_encrypt is the encryption method
# net_key is the secret key
#
# net_hidden is an indicator or a value,
#    - false when unset or null string
#    - true when set to y
#    - the value that is listed by "iw wlan0 scan" instead of
#      the real ssid for a hotspot.
#
# net_blacklisted is an indicator
#    - false, when unset or null string
#    - true, when set to y wwanHotspot will not use this hotspot
#
# net_check is an IP address or an http URL;
# to verify the connection reliability of this hotspot, the router
# will ping this IP or connect to the WEB page URL.
# - leave it unset or null to not check routing,
# - an Internet IP
# - an URL of type http[s]://
#   in this case installation of the wget package is recommended,
#   otherwise an URL is properly checked when the STA interface is
#   the only one connected to the Internet.
# - a not valid IP will make wwanHotspot guess one. Then will ping the
# gateway for this network. In this case will not really check Internet's
# connection, it checks only the connection to the hotspot.
#
# When this list is empty wwanHotspot will use the currently configured
# ssid, and will not modify it. In this case, the variables "hidden",
# "blacklisted" and "check" are initially unset. However, you can modify
# this if you set the corresponding values for hotspot number one. i.e:
# net1_hidden="y"
# net1_check="http://google.com/"
